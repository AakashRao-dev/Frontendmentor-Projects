### Why certain Semantic tags are used?

- **Metadata (author, date)**: Wrapped in a <footer> within the <article> as this is metadata related to the article.
- **Social links**: Wrapped in an <aside> since they are auxiliary to the main article content.
- **Attribution**: In a <footer> for clarity and proper semantics, as it represents auxiliary information about the page.
